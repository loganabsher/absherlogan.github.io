3/4. *What you will learn* & *how long is the program ( is it online/or in person)*:
Coding Dojo offers course options for beginners all the way up to advanced developers.

The 14-week Onsite Bootcamp is designed for students with little to no prior coding experience and advanced developers. During the program you’ll learn Web fundamentals, such as HTML, CSS and jQuery, and then dive into the industry’s only 3-full stack curriculum with hands-on support from instructors and teaching assistants.

Our Online Bootcamp is an ideal alternative for students who are interested in the Onsite Bootcamp but are unable to make it on campus. As a student, you'll learn two full stacks over a 20-week online course structure. The program is a good fit for everyone from beginners to advanced developers.

Finally, our Dev Accelerators are for experienced developers (1-3 years of coding experience) interested in picking up a new software stack and advancing their technical expertise. Dev Accelerators can be taken on campus at a Coding Dojo location. On-campus enrollment requires four weeks of commitment.
